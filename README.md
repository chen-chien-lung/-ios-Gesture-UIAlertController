This is a samll practice for objective C gesture methods 

I add three types of IOS gesture on this practice.
1.Swipe
2.Pinch
3.Double tap

1.When you chick on the label the swipe to left or right ,the font style will change.

2.When pressing the 'option' button you will see two circle on the screen.
It is just like that you tap the screen by your two fingers together.
Then click and drag ,the label size will zoom in and out.

3.When you double tap the label, it will pop out a alert message to enter some words.
This pop out message is the UIAlertController .
Enter some words and click 'Finish',you will find that the label text changes.
